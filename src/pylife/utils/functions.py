def scattering_range_to_std(T):
    """Convert a scattering range (``TS`` or ``TN`` in DIN 50100:2016-12) into standard deviation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : float
        inverted scattering range

    Returns
    -------
    std : float
        standard deviation corresponding to TS or TN assuming a normal distribution

    Notes
    -----
    Actually ``1/(2*norm.ppf(0.9))*np.log10(T)``

    Inverse of ``std_to_scattering_range()``

    Parameters
    ----------
    std : float
        standard deviation

    Returns
    -------
    T : float

def rossow_cumfreqs(N):
    """Cumulative frequency estimator according to Rossow.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        The sample size of the statistical population

    Returns
    -------
    cumfreqs : numpy.ndarray
        The estimated cumulated frequencies of the N samples

    Notes
    -----
    The returned value is the probability that the next taken sample
    is below the value of the i-th sample of n sorted samples.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> rossow_cumfreqs(1)
    array([0.5])

    If we have one sample, the probability that the next sample will
    be below it is 0.5.

    >>> rossow_cumfreqs(3)
    array([0.2, 0.5, 0.8])

    If we have three sorted samples, the probability that the next
    sample will be
    * below the first is 0.2
    * below the second is 0.5
    * below the third is 0.8
