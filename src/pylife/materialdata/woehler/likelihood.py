        """
        Produces the likelihood functions that are needed to compute the parameters of the woehler curve.
        The likelihood functions are represented by probability and cummalative distribution functions.
        The likelihood function of a runout is 1-Li(fracture). The functions are added together, and the
        negative value is returned to the optimizer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        SD:
            Endurnace limit start value to be optimzed, unless the user fixed it.
        TS:
            The scatter in load direction 1/TS to be optimzed, unless the user fixed it.
        k_1:
            The slope k_1 to be optimzed, unless the user fixed it.
        ND:
            Load-cycle endurance start value to be optimzed, unless the user fixed it.
        TN:
            The scatter in load-cycle direction 1/TN to be optimzed, unless the user fixed it.

        Returns
        -------
        neg_sum_lolli :
            Sum of the log likelihoods. The negative value is taken since optimizers in statistical
            packages usually work by minimizing the result of a function. Performing the maximum likelihood
            estimate of a function is the same as minimizing the negative log likelihood of the function.
