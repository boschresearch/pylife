"""A module for Wöhler curve fatigue data analysis

Overview
========

:class:`FatigueData` is a signal accessor class to handle fatigue data from a
Wöhler test.  They can be analyzed by several analyzers according to your choice

* :class:`Elementary` only treats the finite zone of the fatigue data and
  calculates the slope and the scatter in lifetime direction.  It is the base
  class for all other analyzers

* :class:`Probit` calculates parameters not calculated by :class:`Elementary`
  using the Probit method.

* :class:`MaxLikeInf` calculates parameters not calculated by :class:`Elementary`
  using the maximum likelihood method.

* :class:`MaxLikeFull` calculates all parameters using the maximum likelihood
  method.  The result from :class:`Elementary` is used as start values.
