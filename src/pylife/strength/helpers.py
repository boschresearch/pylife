    Calculate the irregularity factor of a turning point sequence based on a rainflow matrix and its residuals.

    Two sided irregularity factor:

        ..math::
        I = N_{mean crossings} / N_{turning points}

    Parameters
    ----------
    rainflow_matrix: np.ndarray[int, int]
        2D-rainflow matrix (must be square shaped)
    residuals: np.ndarray[int], Optional
        1D array of residuals to consider for accurate calculation. Consecutive duplicates are removed beforehand.
        Residuals must be provided as bin numbers.
        Hint: Transformation from physical to binned values possible via np.digitize.
    decision_bin: int, Optional
        Bin number that equals the mean (two-sided). If not provided the decision_bin is inferred by the matrix entries
        as the mean value based on the turning points and will be broadcasted to int-type.

    Todo
    ----
    Future version may provide the one-sided irregularity factor as a second option. Formula would be:

    One sided irregularity factor:

        .. math::

        I = N_{zero bin upwards crossing} / N_{peaks}

    N_{zero bin upwards crossings} equals positive_mean_bin_crossing if `decision_bin` is set to the bin of physical 0.
    Inferring exact amount of peaks from rainflow-matrix and residuals is left to be done.
