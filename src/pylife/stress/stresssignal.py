class StressTensorVoigt(PylifeSignal):
    '''DataFrame accessor class for Voigt noted stress tensors

    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        if at least one of the needed columns is missing.

    Notes
    -----
    Base class to access :class:`pandas.DataFrame` objects containing
    Voigt noted stress tensors. The stress tensor components are assumed
    to be in the columns `S11`, `S22`, `S33`, `S12`, `S13`, `S23`.
