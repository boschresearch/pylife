    Alternatively you can ask the recorder for a histogram matrix:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        rfc.recorder.histogram(bins=16)

    We take four turning points into account to detect closed hysteresis loops.

    Consider four consecutive peak/valley points say, A, B, C, and D  If B and C are
    contained within A and B, then a cycle is counted from B to C; otherwise no cycle is
    counted.

    i.e, If ``X ≥ Y AND Z ≥ Y`` then a cycle exist ``FROM = B`` and ``TO = C``
    where, ranges ``X = |D–C|``, ``Y = |C–B|``, and ``Z = |B–A|``

    ::

        Load -----------------------------
        |        x B               F x
        --------/-\-----------------/-----
        |      /   \   x D         /
        ------/-----\-/-\---------/-------
        |    /     C x   \       /
        --\-/-------------\-----/---------
        |  x A             \   /
        --------------------\-/-----------
        |                    x E
        ----------------------------------
        |              Time

    So, if a cycle exsist from B to C then delete these peaks from the turns array
    and perform next iteration by joining A&D else if no cylce exsists, then B would
    be the next strarting point.

        Parameters
        ----------
        recorder : subclass of :class:`.AbstractRecorder`
            The recorder that the detector will report to.

        """Process a sample chunk.

        Parameters
        ----------
        samples : array_like, shape (N, )
            The samples to be processed

        flush : bool
            Whether to flush the cached values at the end.
            
            If ``flush=False``, the last value of a load sequence is
            cached for a subsequent call to ``process``, because it may or may
            not be a turning point of the sequence, which is only decided
            when the next data point arrives.
            
            Setting ``flush=True`` forces processing of the last value. 
            When ``process`` is called again afterwards with new data, 
            two increasing or decreasing values in a row might have been
            processed, as opposed to only turning points of the sequence.
            
            Example:
            a)
                process([1, 2], flush=False)  # processes 1
                process([3, 1], flush=True)   # processes 3, 1
                -> processed sequence is [1,3,1], only turning points
            
            b)
                process([1, 2], flush=True)   # processes 1, 2
                process([3, 1], flush=True)   # processes 3, 1
                -> processed sequence is [1,2,3,1], "," is not a turning point
                
            c) 
                process([1, 2])   # processes 1
                process([3, 1])   # processes 3
                -> processed sequence is [1,3], end ("1") is missing

            d) 
                process([1, 2])   # processes 1
                process([3, 1])   # processes 3
                flush()           # process 1
