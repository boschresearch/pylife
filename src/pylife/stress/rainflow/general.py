    Parameters
    ----------
    samples : 1D numpy.ndarray
        the sample chunk

    Returns
    -------
    index : 1D numpy.ndarray
        the indeces where sample has a turning point
    turns : 1D numpy.ndarray
        the values of the turning points

    Notes
    -----
    In case of plateaus i.e. multiple directly neighbored samples with exactly
    the same values, building a turning point together, the first sample of the
    plateau is indexed.


    Warnings
    --------
    Any ``NaN`` values are dropped from the input signal before processing it
    and will thus also not appear in the turns.  In those cases a warning is
    issued.  The reason for this is, that if the ``NaN`` appears next to an
    actual turning point the turning point is no longer detected which will
    lead to an underestimation of the damage sum later in the damage
    calculation.  Generally you should not have ``NaN`` values in your signal.
    If you do, it would be a good idea to clean them out before the rainflow
    detection.
