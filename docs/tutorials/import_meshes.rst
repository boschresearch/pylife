How to import meshes
===========================

Fatigue design is often performed on entire finite element meshes.
The following Jupyter notebooks demonstrate how to import finite element meshes in different formats.
* :doc:`ANSYS *.rst files <demos/import_mesh_ansys>`
* :doc:`VMAP files <demos/import_mesh_vmap>`
* It is also possible to import `Abaqus *.odb files`, however an installation of Abaqus is needed. A demo notebook exists (see ``demos/import_mesh_abaqus``) which is not included in this online documentation.
