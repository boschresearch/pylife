Comment:   The component itself is not part of pyLife,
           only the above mentioned files were initially generated by
           PyScaffold as templates and the adjusted versions shipped with
           pyLife.


In the official pyLife docs https://pylife.readthedocs.org various artifacts
(fonts, css, JavaScripts) from the Sphinx RTD Theme are used.  Those are not
part of pyLife, neither are thy shipped along with the pyLife code base,
neither with packages.  They are only used to present the documentation.  To
find out about what artifacts these are and about their licenses we refer to
the developers of the Sphinx RTD Theme: https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io
