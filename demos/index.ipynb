    "\n",
    "pyLife is an Open Source Python library for state of the art algorithms used in lifetime assessment of mechanical components subject to fatigue load.\n",

    "For further information on pyLife checkout the [documentation](https://pylife.readthedocs.io) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/boschresearch/pylife).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclamer:** The demos here are – well – demos, i. e. they are not meant to be used for real calculation. No guaranties whatsoever.\n",
