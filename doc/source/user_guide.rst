pyLife User guide
#################

This document aims to briefly describe the overall design of pyLife and how to
use it inside your own applications, for example Jupyter Notebooks.

pyLife being a library for numerical data analysis and numerical data
processing makes extensive use of `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ and
`numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_. In this guide we suppose that you have a basic
understanding of these libraries and the data structures and concepts they are
using.

For some specific functionality other libraries are used like for example
`scipy <https://scipy.org/>`_.
