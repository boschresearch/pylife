# Installation / Getting started

## Just a glimpse

If you just want to check out pyLife's demos, you can use the our notebooks at
[mybinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/boschresearch/pylife/master?filepath=demos%2Findex.ipynb). We
will add new notebooks as soon as we have new functionality.


## Installation to use pyLife

### Prerequisites

You need a python installation e.g. a virtual environment with `pip` a recent
(brand new ones might not work) python versions installed. There are several
ways to achieve that.

#### Using anaconda

Install anaconda or miniconda [http://anaconda.com] on your computer and create
a virtual environment with the package `pip` installed. See the [conda
documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
on how to do that. The newly created environment must be activated.

The following command lines should do it
```
conda create -n pylife-env python=3.9 pip --yes
conda activate pylife-env
```

#### Using virtualenv

Setup a python virtual environment containing pip according to [these
instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) and activate it.


#### Using the python installation of your Linux distribution

That's not recommended. If you really want to do that, you probably know how to
do it.


### pip install

The simplest way to install pyLife is just using the pip package
```
pip install pylife[all]
```
That installs pyLife with all the dependencies to use pyLife in python
programs. You might want to install some further packages like `jupyter` in
order to work with jupyter notebooks.


There is no conda package as of now, unfortunately.


## Installation to develop pyLife

For general contribution guidelines please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Clone the git repository

Depending on your tools. From the command line
```
git clone https://github.com/boschresearch/pylife.git
```
will do it.

### Install the dependencies

Install anaconda or miniconda [http://anaconda.com]. Create an anaconda
environment with all the requirements by running

Create an environment â€“ usually a good idea to use a prefixed environment in
your pyLife working directory and activate it.

```
conda create -p .venv python=3.9 pip --yes
conda activate ./.venv
```

Then install the pyLife into that environment.

```
pip install -e .[testing,all]
```

### Test the installation

You can run the test suite by the command
```
pytest
```

If it creates an output ending like below, the installation was successful.
```
================ 228 passed, 1 deselected, 13 warnings in 30.45s ===============
```

There might be some `DeprecationWarning`s. Ignore them for now.
